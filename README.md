# RNN password-generator

We start with a list of known passwords. We then clean the data to transform it into a form that the neural network can take.

The next step is to train a recurrent neural network with a LSTM layer on the data. This is then used to generate new passwords. 

There are still signifficant performance improvements to be had, but its a promissing start.
